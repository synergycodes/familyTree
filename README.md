## Family tree

### Description

This project showcases how to build an interactive family tree diagram using GoJS and the go.LayeredDigraphLayout. The implementation demonstrates how to structure and visualize hierarchical family relationships with clear and readable layout logic.

The UI is designed following Synergy Codesâ€™ visual standards, combining intuitive UX with scalable diagramming patterns.

This example serves as a reference for how we typically build GoJS-based applications with clean architecture and reusable components.

### How to run

Run `npm install` in project's root directory to install dependencies.
Then run `npm start` to start the application.

Application should be available at `http://localhost:8080/`
